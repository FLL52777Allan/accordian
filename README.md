This repo was made specificly for a School project. Whoever is reading this (hopefully its my comm tech teacher), please dont use this code for anything. The only purpose of this repo is to make it so that my accordion is interactive (also the accordion code is too long to embed by code so I have to make the site live in github and embed by link).
If it is my comm tech teacher that is reading this, index.html is the final accordion code I embedded into google sites.
please use this code for grading.
